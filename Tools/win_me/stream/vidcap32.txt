Vidcap32.exe is a Video for Windows (VfW) application that uses the VfW 1.1
interfaces to control a video source. Using this binary the VfW to WDM mapper
will be used to control a WDM Video capture minidriver. Vidcap32 is
more fully described in the platform SDK which contains the VfW 1.1 SDK.

For a DirectShow (ActiveMovie) application that use the WDM driver directly,
without the use of the VFW to WDM mapper, see the AMCAP tool.  AMCAP
is described in the amcap.doc located in this directory.
