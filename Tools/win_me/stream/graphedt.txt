Graphedit is a DirectX/DirectShow construction tool that puts
together DirectShow graphs and lets the user run the combined
graph. Graphs you can build include (and are not limited to)
playing DVD's, starting a TV tuner or DV camcorder saving a
movie to disk, playing an MP3 over your sound card.

For complete documentation, please refer to the DirectShow SDK.
