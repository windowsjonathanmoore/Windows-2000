The GetLPTID tool is intended to provide an easy way for developers
to extract the device ID strings from a parallel device.   It displays
everything on the screen which the device returns, including P1284
keywords that may be ignored by Windows 95.  It uses the extracted ID
strings to generate a Windows 95 PnP device ID based on the CRC
algorithm described in the Windows 95 DDK.  This can be useful in
helping developers choose non-conflicting device names.

The tool is simple to use.  Choose the "SelectPort" menu item, pick a
port from the Select Port dialog, and then choose "Get Device ID!" from
the main menu.  The extracted strings will be displayed in the main
window.

The "PnP ID" string is the ID used by the Windows 95 registry.
