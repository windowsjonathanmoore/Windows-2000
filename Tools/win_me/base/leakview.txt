LeakView.exe is supported only for Win9x platform.

If you run "LeakView.exe", it will just give you explorer's GDI and USER
object counts with a small window at the right bottom corner.

If you run "LeakView.exe -a", it will give you all the processes' GDI and
USER object counts in a ListView window, just like Task Manager.  You can
set your refresh rate by going to View|Refresh Rate dialog.  View|Option
will let you add specific object columns.

If you find a suspicious leak, verify by trying it at least four times and
make sure that the count consistently goes up.
