<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

ChkINF is a Perl script
that checks the structure and syntax of Microsoft® Windows® 2000 device driver
.inf files. Results are presented in HTML format, and include a list of the
errors and warnings detected in each .inf file, with each error and warning
shown next to the errant .inf file entry. Please note the Limitations section
below. Note that ChkINF does not support Windows 98 .inf files.<p>

The tool includes support
for all .inf sections and directives that apply to all classes of devices.
ChkINF includes specific device class support for the following device classes:

<blockquote>
  <p>1394 Host Bus Controllers (class = 1394)</p>
  <p>Battery Devices (class = Battery)</p>
  <p>CD-ROM Drivers (class = CDROM)</p>
  <p>Disk Drives (class = DiskDrive)</p>
  <p>Display Adapters (class = Display)</p>
  <p>Floppy Disk Controllers (class = FDC)</p>
  <p>Floppy Disk Drives (class = FloppyDisk)</p>
  <p>Hard Disk Controllers (class = HDC)</p>
  <p>Human Input Devices (class = HIDClass)</p>
  <p>Imaging Devices (class = Image)</p>
  <p>IrDA Devices (class = Infrared) </p>
  <p>Memory Technology Drivers (class = MTD)</p>
  <p>Modems (class = Modem) </p>
  <p>Monitors (class = Monitor) </p>
  <p>Multifunction Devices (class = Multifunction) </p>
  <p>Multi-port Serial Adapters (class = MultiportSerial) </p>
  <p>Network Adapters (class = Net) </p>
  <p>PCMCIA Adapters (class = PCMCIA) </p>
  <p>Ports - COM &amp; LPT serial ports (class = Ports) </p>
  <p>SCSI and RAID Controllers (class = SCSIAdapter) </p>
  <p>Smart Card Readers (class = SmartCardReader) </p>
  <p>Storage Volumes (class = Volume) </p>
  <p>System Devices (class = System) </p>
  <p>USB (class = USB) </p>
</blockquote>

<p> ChkINF does not check device specific INF extension for the following device classes:

<blockquote>
  <p>Keyboards (class = Keyboard)</p>
  <p>Medium Changers (class = MediumChanger)</p>
  <p>Mice (class = Mouse) </p>
  <p>Multimedia (class = Media)</p>
  <p>Network Clients (class = NetClient)</p>
  <p>Network Service (class = NetService) </p>
  <p>Network Transport (class = NetTrans) </p>
  <p>Printers (class = Printer) </p>
  <p>Tape Drives (class = TapeDrive) </p>
</blockquote>


<p>The tool has not been extensively tested. Review your results carefully. </p>

<h3>RUNNING THE TOOL</h3>

<p><b>Note:</b>  Because ChkINF is a Perl script,
in order to use the tool you will need to obtain a Perl interpreter. ChkINF
requires a Perl interpreter that is Version 5.003_07 or greater. ChkINF should
work with any version of Perl 5.0 or greater, but has not been tested with any
versions previous to 5.003_07.</p>

<p>ChkINF has been tested
with the following Perl interpreters: 
 </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GNU Perl 5.005_02 compiled for Win32</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perl for Win32 5.003_07 from ActiveWare Internet Corp. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Microsoft neither endorses nor recommends any specific Perl interpreters.</p>

<p>ChkINF is located in the &lt;DDKRoot&gt;\Tools\Chkinf subdirectory, and should be
executed from the Command Prompt.</p>

<p>A batch file, <I>ChkINF.bat</I>, is provided for smooth execution. ChkINF takes the following
arguments: </p>
<font FACE="Courier" SIZE="3">

<pre>
Usage: ChkInf[.bat] &lt;FileList&gt; /L &lt;LogFile&gt; [/B] [/DC &lt;Options&gt;]		
&lt;FileList&gt;		FileName | Wildcard List | Directory Name
/L &lt;LogFile&gt;		Write an NT Log File Named &lt;LogFile&gt;
/B			Launch Default Browser and Display Results
/I &lt;Dir&gt;		Look for INCLUDEd infs in &lt;Dir&gt; instead of current directory
/LO			Verify files copied (CopyFiles) against Layout.inf
/DC &lt;Options&gt;		Use Device Class &lt;Options&gt; When Checking .infs
/DC FAX			Check any Fax keys present in Modem .inf files only
</pre>
</font>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ul>

<li>&quot;FileName&quot; is the name of a single .inf file. <li>&quot;Wildcard&quot; List is a
DOS wildcard (as in &quot;net*.inf&quot;). ChkINF automatically expands wildcards and
checks all applicable .inf files. 
<li>ChkINF checks all .inf files located in the
&quot;DirectoryName&quot; subdirectory. 
<li>/L creates an NT log file. 
<li>The only Device Class option currently supported by the /DC argument is the FAX option, as listed above.

<h4>Output</h4>

<p>ChkINF produces three types of files at the end of the checking process.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Summary.htm: A single HTML file that lists all of the one or more .inf files that were
  checked, along with the number of errors and warnings detected in each one. The name of
  each .inf file is linked to the respective .htm file described below.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>NameofINFfile</i>.htm: Results file produced for each checked .inf file.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>An optional NT Log file may be created (see Running the Tool). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>NameofINFfile.htm includes the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Errors: A list of the errors found in the .inf file, along with the error message and
  the line in the .inf file where it was detected. Each warning includes a link to its
  location in the Annotated INF (see below).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Warnings: A list of the warnings detected in the .inf file, along with the warning
  message and the line in the .inf file where it was detected. Each warning includes a link
  to its location in the Annotated INF (see below).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sections included from other infs: A list of the sections included from other .inf
  files. Each section listed includes a link to its location in the Sections included from
  other infs section (see below). This item is omitted if the .inf being checked did not
  include any sections from other .inf files.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Annotated INF: The complete source for the INF file, with the warning and error
  messages displayed adjacent to the line where the warning or error was detected.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sections included from other infs: The complete source for the included sections, with
  warning and error messages displayed adjacent to the line where the warning or error was
  detected. This section is omitted if the INF being checked did not include any sections
  from other INF files. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>These files are saved into the subdirectory Htm, located off the directory from which
ChkINF is invoked. </p>

<h3>LIMITATIONS</h3>

<p>ChkINF does not support Windows 98
.inf files. ChkINF will not accurately check .inf structure and syntax that is
specific to Windows 98 .inf files. </p>

<p>The tool does not perform
device-class-specific testing for the following device classes: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Keyboards (class = Keyboard)</p>
  <p>Medium Changers (class = MediumChanger)</p>
  <p>Mice (class = Mouse) </p>
  <p>Multimedia (class = Media)</p>
  <p>Network Clients (class = NetClient)</p>
  <p>Network Service (class = NetService) </p>
  <p>Network Transport (class = NetTrans) </p>
  <p>Printers (class = Printer) </p>
  <p>Tape Drives (class = TapeDrive) </p>
</blockquote>


<p>ChkINF has been tested with the following Perl interpreters: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GNU Perl 5.005_02 compiled for Win32</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perl for Win32 5.003_07 from ActiveWare Internet Corp. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>ChkINF does not support Unicode. To
run ChkINF on a Unicode .inf file, first save the file as an ASCII text file. </p>

<p> ChkINF does not automatically search 
the <I>\Winnt\Inf</I> directory or any other directory for INCLUDEd .inf files. Use the 
/I argument when calling ChkINF to direct the tool to look for INCLUDEd .inf files in a specific directory. </p>

<p> ChkINF warns for any sections that are not referenced by a directive
elsewhere in the INF file. This is a change from previous versions of the tool,
which reported errors for un-referenced sections. </p>

<p> For Display .inf files, ChkINF does not check for all relevant Registry keys. An .inf file that passes
with no errors may not function correctly. </p>
