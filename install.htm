<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Times New Roman" SIZE=2>The Microsoft<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Windows<SUP>&reg;</SUP> 2000 Driver Development Kit (DDK) provides a development environment
for the creation of Windows&nbsp;2000 and WDM drivers. The DDK provides additional 
driver-specific headers, libraries, sources, tools, and documentation that are used to develop drivers for 
Windows&nbsp;2000.</FONT>

This release of the Windows&nbsp;2000 DDK <I>must</I>
be used to develop drivers for corresponding release of the Windows&nbsp;2000 operating system, and WDM drivers. You cannot use this DDK to create drivers for earlier versions of Windows&nbsp;2000 or for Windows&nbsp;NT<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;4.0.
In addition, driver development requires 
Microsoft Visual C++<SUP>&reg;</SUP> 5.x or 6.x, Professional or Enterprise edition.  Microsoft Visual C++ Academic or Standard editions are not supported.</FONT></TD></TR>

To install the Microsoft<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Windows<SUP>&reg;</SUP>&nbsp;2000 
DDK, you must be able to access a CD-ROM drive from Windows&nbsp;2000, either locally or through a network, or you must 
have Internet access to the <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ddk">Driver Development Kits</A> Web site.</FONT>

<P>

<B><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=+1>System Requirements</FONT></B><P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Times New Roman" SIZE=2>To use this DDK on your <B>driver-development</B> machine, you will need:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Microsoft<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Windows&nbsp;2000, or Windows<SUP>&reg;</SUP> 98.
<LI>Microsoft Visual C++<SUP>&reg;</SUP> 5.0 or 6.0, Professional or Enterprise edition. Microsoft Visual C++ Academic or Standard editions are not supported. Additionally, you must install the latest Visual C++ service pack that is available for the version you are using. See the Release Notes for more information.  Setup.exe will copy the Release Notes file from the CD to the root directory of the DDK installation.  Please see the root directory of the CD, or the installation, for Release Notes (<a href="relnote.htm"><I>relnote.htm</I></a>) and late-breaking news.
<LI>CD-ROM drive or Internet access.
	<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>This DDK is available on CD-ROM from MSDN&trade; or by download from the <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ddk">Driver Development Kits</A> Web page. For a list of  CD-ROM drives, computer
	systems, SCSI adapters, and other peripherals that are compatible with Windows&nbsp;2000, see the <I>Hardware Compatibility List</I>, available on the Web 
	at <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/hwtest">http://www.microsoft.com/hwtest</A>.</FONT>
<LI>At least 64MB RAM.  128MB of RAM or more is recommended.
<LI>Up to 200MB hard-disk space for a full installation.  Significantly more space may be required to compile all samples; up to 750MB may be required.
</UL></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial,Times New Roman" SIZE=2>To use this DDK on your <B>driver-testing</B> machine, you will need:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Microsoft Windows&nbsp;2000.
<LI>At least 64MB RAM if you are running a <I>free</I> or retail build of Windows&nbsp;2000; 
64MB RAM if running a <I>checked</I> build.  In some cases, checked builds may require 128MB of RAM, depending on the particular drivers loaded on the machine.
<LI>A second machine that is capable of running Windows&nbsp;2000 for kernel debugging of your under-development drivers.  This machine can be your driver-development system if desired.
</UL>
If you are developing WDM Drivers for the Win9x platform, you will need to consult the <b>Windows 98 DDK</b> for information on debugging on that platform.</FONT>

Perform the following steps:
<p>
<OL>
<LI>Execute the <I>setup.exe</I> file from the CD-ROM or execute <I>ntddk.exe</I> after downloading it from the <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ddk">Driver Development Kits</A> Web page.
<LI>Click the <b>Next</b> button to install the Windows&nbsp;2000 DDK.
<LI>Read and accept the Software License Agreement. 
<LI>Click the <B>Next</B> button to proceed.
<LI>Select the installation path (it is suggested to use the path that is displayed).
<LI>Click the <B>Next</B> button to proceed.
<LI>Choose the components that you would like to install.
<LI>Click the <B>Next</B> button to proceed.
<LI>Confirm that you want to install the DDK by verifying that the installation path is correct. 
<LI>Click the <B>Next</B> button to install the kit.
</OL>
<P>The <I>setenv.bat</I> batch file sets the necessary environment variables to build free or checked driver versions. To run <I>setenv.bat</I>, start either a free or checked console
window from the Programs\Development Kits\Kit 2195\Build Environments. Drivers can then be built by running
the BUILD utility. Invoking <B>build</B> <B>-cZ</B> at the command-line
prompt compiles and links all drivers in the source tree of the current
subdirectory.

<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Times New Roman" SIZE=2>The build environment is set from the icons
for a free or checked build. If the build environment is not created correctly,
you can manually set the build environment by going to the %NTDDK%\bin

<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Times New Roman" SIZE=2>The Windows&nbsp;2000 DDK uses the current VCVars.bat to create part of the build environment. This includes setting your current
path to include the installation source of Visual C++. You may want to delete
the line <I>vcsource=</I>&lt;Install Path&gt; from %DDKRoot%\Bin\DDKVars.bat
if you installed the DDK over a network. Doing so may reduce the time
required to build the drivers.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>Start either the <I>free</I> or <I>checked</I> build environment by choosing the appropriate icon from the
 Windows&reg;&nbsp;2000 DDK menu. 

<P>Verify your installation of the Windows&nbsp;2000 DDK by running <B>build</B> <B>-cZ</B> 
from the %NTDDK%\src
directory to build the complete set of installed driver sources. This can
take more than 30 minutes to complete, depending on which DDK components
are installed.

<P>Also included in this release of the DDK is a <b>complete</b> 64-bit build environment for the upcoming Microsoft<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Win64&#153; systems.
<P>To compile your driver with the 64-bit compiler, choose the <B>Checked 64 Bit Build Environment</B> or <B>Free 64 Bit Build Environment</B> icon in <I>Programs\Development Kits\Kit 2195\Build Environment</I>.  This will open the correct environment for the 64-bit compiler.

<P>WHQL customers benefit in the following ways:<BR>
<UL><LI>Devices approved by WHQL are included in the <I>Hardware
Compatibility List</I>, which is periodically updated on the Web at <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/hwtest">http://www.microsoft.com/hwtest</A>.
<UL><LI>This list is used by many Microsoft customers to make purchasing decisions.
It also is used by Microsoft support engineers while assisting customers
with compatibility issues.</UL>
<LI>If your device and its drivers pass WHQL testing for compatibility with specific Windows operating systems, you are eligible
to use the appropriate logos in
promotional materials for that device. For example, WHQL logos include &quot;Windows&nbsp;2000 Compatible&quot; and &quot;Windows 98 Compatible.&quot;
