**	AEP_INITIALIZE definition:
**
**	IOS makes this during the registration of a layer driver. In the case
** of a port driver registration IOS checks to see if the init was a success.
** If so IOS sends down an AEP_INQUIRE_DCB discussed below. If the 
** AEP_INQUIRE was successful IOS sends an AEP_CONFIG_DCB call to all the
** layer drivers. It then repeats the AEP_INQUIRE_DCB call. In the case of
** SCSI IOS makes as many inquiries as is specified in AEP_bi_i_max_target
** returned in the AEP_INITIALIZE call. Also in the case of SCSI the scan 
** order can be sepcified AEP_bi_flags. If AEP_BI_FL_SCSI_SCAN_DOWN is set 
** the scanning is done in the reverse order. 
**
** The driver can also set AEP_BI_FL_SEND_CONFIG_AGAIN in AEP_bi_flags. If 
** this is set IOS will redo the whole sequence of AEP_INITIALIZE, 
** AEP_INQUIRE and AEP_CONFIG again. This is typically not needed as IOS
** will call the port driver again if the port driver controls more than 
** controller. 
**
** Note that in the case of a non-scsi port diver IOS sends down as 
** AEP_INQUIRY until the driver says AEP_NO_MORE_DEVICES in the result 
** field.  If the result of the AEP_INQUIRY was AEP_NO_INQ_DATA then the
** next location is inquired and there is no config call sent out.

/*
**  AEP_MOUNT_NOTIFY definitions
**
**  This call is made when the IFS Manager has successfully mounted a
**  new volume, but before the operation which caused the mount has
**  been completed.
**
**	This call is made to allow a driver which creates child volumes from
**  special files on the volume (e.g., a DBLSPACE driver which causes
**  CVFs to appear as volumes) to find such files and prepare them
**  for mounting.  Conceivably, it could be used by other drivers
**  who want to know when a new volume is mounted for other purposes.
**
**  The callee's response can have the following effects:
**
**  - The original volume can be associated with a different drive,
**    e.g., the original volume could be moved from drive A: to
**    drive H:.  If such a move is made and the target drive is
**    already in use, IFSMGR will attempt to unmount the current
**    volume for that drive.  Note that either or both the original
**    volume's effective and actual drives may be changed.  E.g.,
**    drive G: is the host for DBLSPACE drive E:, E: and G: are
**    swapped (meaning if there were no compressed drive E:, G:
**    would be known as E:), and G: is also host for another
**    compressed drive H:.  E:, G:, and H: are all visible in
**    real mode.  The user's first access may touch any of these
**    drives first.  Whichever drive letter is used first, G: will
**    be the first drive mounted.  Thus, the Compressed Volume
**    Manager will respond that the drive's effective name is really
**    G: and its actual name is really E:.
**
**  - A bitmap of child volumes to mount can be returned.  The low-
**    order bit corresponds to drive A: and so forth.  For each
**    bit in the bitmap, the IFSMGR will send a mount child volume
**    command to the same FSD that mounted the original volume.
**    The child volumes and their parent (the original volume) share
**    the same VRP; this is the mechanism by which the relationship
**    among the volumes is maintained.
**
**  If the returned bitmap is zero, then the IFSMGR takes no additional
**  action regardless of any change in the drive number.  Thus, the
**  valid responses are to do nothing, or to cause one or more child
**  volumes to be mounted, optionally moving the parent to a new
**  drive while reusing the original drive for one of the child
**  volumes.
