          <p>Public newsgroups are available for peer-to-peer support. As time
          and resources allow, Microsoft developers, program managers, support
          engineers, and test engineers visit the site to collect feedback and
          answer questions or correct misperceptions. They often read feedback,
          but they do not become actively involved unless a specific question is
          asked or a misperception is observed. Participation largely depends on
          bandwidth and time, which is greatly affected by shipping schedules;
          there is no official Microsoft involvement in the public newsgroups.</p>
          <p>To gain access to the public Platform SDK newsgroups, use your
          preferred newsgroup reader and configure the news server address as <b>msnews.microsoft.com</b>.
          The public Platform SDK newsgroups are under <b>microsoft.public</b><strong>.platformsdk</strong>.
          No account name nor password is required.</p>
