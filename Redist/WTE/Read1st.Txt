1.0  Before you Install
======================================================================

1. This release software may be installed on Microsoft Windows 2000
   systems for the x86 platform only.

2. Upgrading from any earlier preliminary Web Telephony Engine release
   is not supported. If you have an earlier preliminary Web Telephony
   Engine release installed, uninstall the earlier version before
   installing the Web Telephony Engine.

3. This release is available in US English only.

4. In order for a Web Telephony Engine computer to be part of an
   array, its configuration must be stored in the Active Directory. To
   do so, you must first import the Web Telephony Engine schema before
   installing Web Telephony Engine on a computer which is part of a
   Windows 2000 domain. To import the schema, use the WTEImp.exe tool,
   located in the REDIST directory.

5. Setup should be run in the context of an account that belongs to the
   administrators group of the machine. Additionally, If Web Telephony 
   Engine is configured to use the Active Directory, Setup should be run 
   in the context of an account that is an administrator in the Active 
   Directory.

6. You cannot reinstall Web Telephony Engine using the Add/Remove
   Programs applet (from the Control Panel) because it is part of a
   self-extracted file. Reinstall by running WTESETUP.EXE again.

7. Setup asks for the account that Web Telephony Engine service will
   be running in its context. This account must be a member of the
   Administrator group or the Local System account.

8. If, during the setup process, you do not see any previously-installed 
   WTE arrays listed in the "Web Telephony Engine Domain Setup" dialog box, 
   abort setup, replicate the domain controllers, and rerun setup. 
   NOTE: Alternatively, wait for the next scheduled replication, and then 
   rerun setup. Refer to ADS documentation for more information on the 
   replication process and configuration.


======================================================================
2.0  Importing the Web Telephony Engine Schema
======================================================================

You can store Microsoft Web Telephony Engine configuration information
in the Registry or in the Windows 2000 Active Directory. If you use
the Active Directory to store configuration information, you must
first import the Microsoft Web Telephony Engine schema.

WTEIMP.EXE is a self-extracting executable that imports Microsoft
Web Telephony Engine schema to the Active Directory.


======================================================================
3.0  Setting up Web Telephony Engine
======================================================================

WTESETUP.EXE is a self-extracting executable that installs Microsoft
Web Telephony Engine (WTE).

>>>To run unattended setup
--------------------------
1. Set the environment variable WTE_INSTALL_FLAGS to one of the 
   following:
   * /q, to suppress all dialog boxes except the exit dialog box.
   * /q1, to suppress all dialog boxes, including the exit dialog box.
   * /qt, to suppress dialog boxes for the entire setup process,
     including the blue background and the copy gauge.
            
If you run unattended setup, Web Telephony Engine will be installed to
the "%ProgramFiles%\Web Telephony Engine" directory. The WTE service
will be set to use the local system account.

To change the default installation directory for unattended setup,
create a file named "wte.ini" in the %WINDIR% directory, with the
following lines:

   [WTE Setup Install]
   ; The installation directory
   Install Dir=Directory_Name

where Directory_Name is the directory in which the Web Telephony 
Engine will be installed.
