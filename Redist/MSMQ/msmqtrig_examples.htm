<H2>MSMQ Triggers Example</H2>

<HR>

<P>Suppose you create a new trigger named &quot;PrivateTrigger&quot; that is associated with the private queue &quot;Mycomputer\Myqueue&quot;, and is comprised of two rules: &quot;MyRule1&quot; and &quot;MyRule2&quot;.</P>

<P>Each of these rules defines a condition (such as Message Label Contains &quot;marketing&quot;) and an action to be taken when the condition is true (such as open &quot;Pbrush.exe&quot; with parameter &quot;Message Label&quot;). In addition, a rule handler object is attached to the rule, by default this is the supplied IMSMQRuleHandler.</P>

<P>When a message arrives at Mycomputer\Myqueue, the MSMQ Triggers Service is notified. Next, for the &quot;PrivateTrigger&quot; trigger defined for that queue, the rules &quot;MyRule1&quot; and &quot;MyRule2&quot; associated with that trigger are applied. Lastly, Microsoft Paint is opened if all the conditions for those triggers are met (are true).</P>
