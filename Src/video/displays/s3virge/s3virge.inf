Microsoft does not provide any sample video driver inf files because trying
to create a new inf starting from a sample generally causes bugs in the inf.

Instead, Microsoft provides a tool called "videoinf.exe" which will generate
an inf for your video driver.  This tools will ask you questions about your
hardware and driver, and will generate the inf for you.

You can then edit and add any extra data you need to this inf afterwards.
