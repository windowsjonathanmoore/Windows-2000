Installation:
-------------

   ATITUNEP is not a true PnP driver, since it is accessed via the I2C bus 
controlled by the graphics device for which no bus enumerator exists.

   ATITUNEP exists as a child device of the display device.  It is force
installed by the following lines in \windows\inf\DxATI.inf:

[ATI_M64.AIW.AddReg]
HKR,"ENUM\Device1",pnpid,,"atitunep"

--------               

   1.  WebTV for Windows
   
   - Install an ATI All-In-Wonder or All-In-Wonder Pro adapter.
   - Since subvendor IDs are not available in the Rage3 to distinguish 
     different hardware configurations, you must manually select the 
     appropriate driver to install:
      All-In-Wonder (ati_m64)   
      All-In-Wonder PRO (atir3)
   - Install WebTV for Windows

   2.  GraphEdt.exe
   
   - Make sure you're using a version of DShow 5.2 or better 
      GraphEdt.exe. This is needed to support new PnP features.
