Windows File Protection
</FONT></B>
<!----------------------  SUMMARY -------------------------->
<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=2>
<p>Installation programs that are not part of the operating
system can overwrite shared system files. This has been a common problem in the
history of the Microsoft® Windows® operating systems. Overwriting shared system
files can result in unpredictable system performance that ranges from
application errors to operating system crashes. The files types that are most
commonly affected by this problem are dynamic-link libraries (DLL) and
executable files (EXE).</p>

<p>In Microsoft® Windows®&nbsp;2000, a new feature called Windows
File Protection (WFP) will prevent the replacement of certain monitored system
files. By preventing the replacement of essential system files, file version
mismatches can be avoided.</p>

<p>WFP protects system files by running in the background and
detecting attempts to replace protected system files. Windows File Protection
is triggered after it receives a directory change notification on a file in a
protected directory. Once this notification is received, WFP determines which file
was changed. If the file is protected, WFP looks up the file signature in a
catalog file to determine if the new file is the correct Microsoft version. If
it is not, the operating system replaces the file with the correct version from
the dllcache directory or the distribution media.</p>

<p>After detecting the replacement of a protected file, WFP
searches for the replaced files in the following order:</p>

<ol><li type="1">Search
the dllcache directory.</li>

<li type="1">If the
system was installed via network install, search the network install path.
</li>
<li type="1">Search
on the CD.</li></ol>

<p>If the file is found in dllcache or the install source is
auto-located, WFP will replace the file without prompting the user and move on. If the file
cannot be found, WFP displays a dialog box that prompts the user to either
insert CD media or cancel the restore operation.</p>

<p>WFP also logs an event to the system event log, noting the
file replacement attempt. If the administrative user cancels the WFP file
restoration, an event noting the cancel will be logged.</p>

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> The “hit rate” of the dllcache directory is related to the size of the
cache specified in the SFCQuota setting. See <i>Protected File List</i>, below, for more information about the SFCQuota
setting.</FONT></p>
<!------------------------System File Checker--------------------->
<B><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=+2>System File Checker</FONT></B>
<p><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>
A command-line utility called System File Checker
(SFC.EXE) allows an Administrator to scan all protected files to verify their
versions. System File Checker can also set the registry value SFCScan
discussed below in <i>Additional Registry Settings</i>.

<p>System File Checker will also check and repopulate the
%Systemroot%\system32\dllcache directory. If the dllcache directory becomes
corrupted or unusable, SFC /SCANNOW, /SCANONCE /SCANBOOT, or /PURGECACHE can be
used to repair the contents of the dllcache directory.</p>

<p>Syntax of SFC.exe:</p>

<p>Scans all protected system files
and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</p>

<p>SFC [/SCANNOW] [/SCANONCE]
[/SCANBOOT] [/CANCEL] [/QUIET] [/PURGECACHE] [/CACHESIZE=x] </p>

<p>/SCANNOW Scans all protected system files immediately.</p>

<p>/SCANONCE Scans all protected system files once.
<p>/SCANBOOT Scans all protected system
files at every boot.
<p>/CANCEL Cancels all pending scans of
protected system files.
<p>/QUIET Replaces all incorrect file
versions without prompting the user.</p>

<p>/PURGECACHE Purges the file cache and
scans all protected system files immediately.
<p>/CACHESIZE=x Sets the file cache size
(in megabytes).</p></FONT>
<!--------------------Supported File Replacement Mechanisms------------>
<B><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=+2>Supported File Replacement Mechanisms</FONT></B>
<p><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>
Replacement of protected system files is supported using
the following mechanisms:

<ul><li>Windows&nbsp;2000 Service Pack
installation (UPDATE.EXE)</li>
<li>Hotfix distributions installed using HOTFIX.EXE</li>
<li>Operating system upgrade (WINNT32.EXE)</li>
<li>Windows Update</li>
<li>Windows&nbsp;2000 Device Installer</li>
</ul>
<p>Replacing protected files by other means than those mentioned above,
results in the files being replaced by WFP.</p>

<p>To update third-party drivers that ship with
Windows&nbsp;2000, driver developers will have two options:</p>

<ul><li>Submit
the finished driver update to Windows Hardware Quality Labs (<a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/hwtest">http://www.microsoft.com/hwtest</a>) for
certification.  If the driver passes, it
will be signed by WHQL and will be installable via the Device Installer without
issue.</li>

<li>Install
an unsigned version of a driver that is undergoing WHQL certification.  By default, the Windows&nbsp;2000 Device
Installer will give the user a warning dialog box when an attempt is made to
install an unsigned driver.  The user
can choose to override that warning and install the unsigned driver.</li>
</ul></FONT>
<!------------------------Protected File List-------------------------->
<B><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=+2>Protected File List</FONT></B>
<p><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>
<b>All SYS,
DLL, EXE, and OCX files that ship on the Windows&nbsp;2000 CD are protected. True
Type fonts &#151; Micross.ttf, Tahoma.ttf, and Tahomabd.ttf &#151; are also protected.</b>

<p>Maintaining cached versions of all these files in the dllcache
directory is not desirable on all systems due to disk space considerations.
Depending on the size of the registry value
<b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SFCQuota</b> (default is 0x32h (50MB) for Professional;
all Windows&nbsp;2000 files are cached on Server products), WFP keeps verified file
versions cached in the dllcache directory on the system hard drive. WFP adds
files to the cache until the size of the dllcache directory reaches the
SFCQuota value. Setting the SFCQuota value to 0xFFFFFFFF hex causes WFP to
cache all protected system files. SFCQuota = 0xFFFFFFFFh is the default setting for
Server and Advanced Server.</p>

<p>After Setup is complete, WFP runs a scan of all protected
files to ensure that they have not been modified by applications that were installed
using unattended installation methods. This scan also populates the dllcache
directory with verified file versions. If the dllcache directory becomes
corrupted, run SFC /PURGECACHE. SFC will delete the contents of the dllcache directory, rescan all Windows&nbsp;2000
files, and repopulate the dllcache directory with verified file versions.</p>

<p>The location of the dllcache directory is specified in
<b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SFCDllCacheDir (REG_EXPAND_SZ)</b>. The default value
for SFCDllCacheDir is %Systemroot%\system32\dllcache. The SFCDllCacheDir setting must be
a local path.</p>

<p>In some instances WFP may not be able to locate the
correct version of a system file in the dllcache directory. The dllcache
directory might contain an outdated version of the file, or not contain
any version of the file at all. In such a case WFP will attempt to locate the
installation media. If WFP cannot find the installation media, it will prompt the user to insert
the appropriate media. WFP will then replace the incorrect file version that is
being used by the operating system or that has been found in the dllcache
directory.</p></FONT>

<!-----------------Disabling Windows File Protection-------------------->
<B><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=+2>Disabling Windows File Protection</FONT></B>

<p><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" SIZE=-1>
You may disable WFP by setting the value SFCDisable
(REG_DWORD) in <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon</b>. By default, SFCDisable is set to 0, which means WFP
is active. Setting SFCDisable to 1 will disable WFP. Setting SFCDisable
to 2 will disable WFP for the next system restart only (without a prompt to re-enable).

<p><b>You must
have a kernel debugger attached to the system via null modem cable (for example:I386kd.exe or Windbg.exe) to use SFCDisable = 1 or SFCDisable = 2.</b></p>

<p>After WFP is disabled using the SFCDisable = 1 setting, the
following message will appear after logon:<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Warning!
Windows File Protection is not active on this system. Would you like to enable
Windows File Protection now? This will
enable Windows File Protection until the next system restart. &lt;Yes&gt;
&lt;No&gt;."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>Clicking <b>Yes</b>
will reactivate WFP until the next system restart. This message will appear at every
successful logon until SFCDisable is set to 0.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> The above message will only be presented to
Administrators.</p></FONT>
