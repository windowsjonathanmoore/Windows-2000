This directory contains Microsoft Platform SDK samples.
These samples demonstrate the use of interfaces and APIs for
Windows and BackOffice. The samples run on Windows 95, Windows NT 4.0,
Windows 98 & Windows 2000.
Some of the samples use interfaces or APIs that are only available
on certain operating systems or releases, or after certain runtimes &
redistributables have been installed.  Refer to the ReadMe.Txt in the
root of the Microsoft Platform SDK CD for more information about how to
build an application targeting the various platforms.
<P>
The build environment (headers, libraries, and minimum build
tools) for the Microsoft Platform SDK must be installed in order to build
any of the samples beneath this directory. The build
environment can be installed by running
setup.exe on the root of the Microsoft Platform SDK CD. The most
recent version of the build environment is also for download at
