<H2>Setting up and running the Sample</H2>

<P>                   This takes the form of a number of COM components that can be used from a language like Visual Basic to achieve highly scalable data access and marshalling for n-tier application scenarious.</P>
<P>The following instructions show how the components can be setup and used 
against the SQL Server 7.0 sample "Northwind" database.</P>
<OL>
	<LI>Build the DataServices sample according to the <A 
  href="EntityProxy.htm">instructions</A>.
  <LI>Create a new ODBC System DSN "Northwind" that points 
  to the "Northwind" database in SQL Server 7.0. 
  
	<LI>Use the SQL Server 7.0 Query Analyzer to execute the <A href="NorthwindSPs.sql">NorthwindSPs.sql</A>  script which will add the required stored procedures to the Nortwind Database. These stored procedures were generated using the Entity Proxy <A href="epgen.htm">EPGen</A> tool. 
  
	<LI>Use the Visual Basic <A href = "EPTest.htm">EPTest</A> application to 
	  test the functionality the Entity Proxy DataServices components. You can use 
	  the SQL Server 7.0 Profiler application to view the database operations as 
	  they happen. The output for the <A href = "EPTest.htm">EPTest</A> application should look something 
	  like:
		<CODE>
			<P>+SQL: BatchStarting EXEC spCustomersLoad @CustomerID =                  "RANCH"</P>
			<P>+SQL: BatchStarting EXEC spProductsLoad @ProductID =             42</P>
			<P>+SQL: BatchStarting EXEC spOrdersInsert @OrderID = 0, 
  @CustomerID =   "RANCH", @EmployeeID = 3, 
  @OrderDate =   "October 6  1999", 
			  @RequiredDate =     "October 6  1999", @ShippedDate = "October 6  1999", @ShipVia =                1, @Freight = 17.52, @ShipName = "Sergio Gutiérrez", @ShipAddress = "Av. del Libertador 900", @ShipCity = "Buenos Aires", @ShipRegion = NULL, @ShipPostalCode = "1010", @ShipCountry = "Argentina"</P>
			<P>+SQL: BatchStarting EXEC spOrderDetailsInsert @OrderID 
  =   11083, @ProductID 
  =     42, @UnitPrice = 14, @Quantity = 1, @Discount =       0</P>
		</CODE>
	<LI>The Entity Proxy DataServices can be viewed as a data 
  access mechanism in a similar way to ADO, and as such can be used from within 
  a COM+ component where database connections will correctly enlist into any 
  existing transaction.</LI>                  
</OL>
