The \Microsoft Platform SDK\Samples\COM\MTSonly directory contains samples for MTS 2.0 application development.  Although these samples can be built and run with COM+ on Windows 2000, they should primarily be used as samples for building applications targeted for MTS because some of the programming techniques shown aren't the best approach for targeting COM+.

The build environment (headers, libraries, and minimum build
tools) for the Platform SDK must be installed in order to build
any of the samples in the \Microsoft Platform SDK\Samples directory. The build
environment can be installed from the readme.htm or by running
setup.exe on the root of the Platform SDK compact disc. The most
recent version of the build environment is also available at
http://msdn.microsoft.com/developer/sdk/.

Some components may also require you to install runtimes, depending
on the platform on which you are trying to run the sample.
Redistributables are available in the \Microsoft Platform SDK\Redist subdirectory
on the Platform SDK compact disc.

Documentation for the components listed above can be installed
from the Platform SDK compact disc, or can be viewed online at
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/. This is a free service;
registration is necessary.
