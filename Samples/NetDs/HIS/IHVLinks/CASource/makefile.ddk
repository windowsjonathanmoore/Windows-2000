# Use makefile.ddk when using the Windows NT DDK to build this sample
# If you are using the Platform SDK, then use the "makefile"
#
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!!!  Edit .\sources. if you want to add a new source
# file to this component.  This file merely indirects to the real make file
# that is shared by all the driver components of the Windows NT DDK
