	TAPI 3.0 Rendezvous Controls Sample Program


What the sample does?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RendSam is a simple program demonstrates how to use TAPI 3.0 Rendezvous Controls COM interfaces to 

. open an ILS directory, 
. configure a conference, 
. add a conference,
. enumerate conferences, 
. delete a conference,
. configure a user,
. add a user,
. enumerate users, and
. delete a user,

A few methods in TAPI 3.0 SDPBLB COM interfaces are also used in configuring a conference.


How to build the sample program?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set the SDK build environment (see SDK readme file.), then type "nmake" in this "Rend" directory. RendSam.exe will be built.


How to use the sample program?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After RendSam.exe is built, run 
	RendSam <ils>
where <ils> is the name or IP address of an ILS server. Note that credentials of the currently logged on user's will be used to bind to the ILS server.


What this sample does not show?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This sample does not query NTDS to find all available ILS servers, instead an ILS server is specified in command line. Conference and user configurations were minimal. One can use other methods in Rendezvous Control or SDP BLOB COM interfaces to do more complex configurations. 


 
Additional Notes on how to build the sample: 

 How to build the samples with VC6 or VC5:
-	IMPORTANT: start a new command prompt (cmd.exe), 
	or start a new "Set Win32 Environment" 
	cmd window from Programs - Microsoft Platform SDK .
-	go to the path where you installed VC6 
	(e.g. C:\ Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Bin) 
	and type VCVARS32.BAT.
-	go to the path where you installed SDK 
	(e.g. C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK) 
	and type SetEnv.Bat.
-	check the following environment variables: 
	PATH, LIB, INCLUDE. You can see their current 
	values by typing "SET" at the command prompt. 
	You should see that they contain first the SDK 
	paths and then the VC6 paths.
-	go to the path where the TAPI sample 
	(TAPI2 and TAPI3) is installed and type NMAKE.
