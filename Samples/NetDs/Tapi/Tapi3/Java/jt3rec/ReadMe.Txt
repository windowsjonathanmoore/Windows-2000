SUMMARY
=======

The JT3Rec sample application/applet demonstrates the use of the Telephony API
3.0 to receive incoming calls.

Depending on installed hardware, the applet will allow you to communicate with
others over a network connection using streaming audio and video.


BEFORE YOU COMPILE/RUN THE SAMPLE
=================================

Before you can compile/run the sample you must perform the following steps:

1. Configure the Telephoney API 3.0
-----------------------------------
TAPI 3.0 is installed by default in Windows NT 5.0.  To ensure that telephoney
support is properly configured on your machine, go to the control panel and
open the "Telephoney" control panel applet.

2.Create the classes.zip file
==============================
Goto the %windir%\system32 directory and run clspack.exe as
clspack -auto
This should generate the classes.zip file in the %windir%\java\classes directory



If you must upgrade to a newer version of the VM, install the version that
comes with the SDK for Java 2.0 (http://www.microsoft.com/java) since you will
need the SDK for the following step.

3. Generate Java/COM Integration Classes
----------------------------------------
Java classes must be generated for TAPI 3.0.  To generate these classes you
will need to have the SDK for Java 2.0 (or later) installed.  Once you have installed
the SDK, copy CreateComClassesForTapi3.bat to the \bin directory under the main SDK install 
directory (C:\SDK-Java.201 by default) and run it.

WARNING! You must use Jvc version 1.02.3920 or greater to compile files
	 generated by JActiveX.

This will generate the .class files needed to access TAPI 3.0 from Java in the
C:\Winnt\java\trustlib\tapi3 directory.

For more information on how to generate Java/COM
integration classes refer to the SDK for Java 2.01 or later documentation.


HOW TO COMPILE THE SAMPLE
=========================

Once the above steps are complete you can compile JT3Rec by executing the
makeall.bat file.

TO COMPILE USING VJ

1. Install VJ++
2. Create a new Windows Application project
	
	Note:  Select Yes to enable language extensions.
3. Remove the default form1.java file
4. Add following files from the <Platform SDK Dir>\samples\netds\tapi\tapi3\java\jt3call, where
<Platform SDK Dir> is the directory where you installed the Platform SDK.
	appctrls.java
	dialoglayout.java
	jt3call.java

	A. Right-click the default project
	B. Select Add then Add Class
	C. Change to existing tab
	D. Browse to file location above
	E. Add all of the files above
5. Right-click on the default project and select project properties
6. On the Classpath tab add the following new path:
	%windir%\java\classes

	Note: Replace %windir% with the correct windows path.
7. On the Output Format tab, make sure Packaging type is set to Windows EXE.  Note the value of 
the File name field.  This is the destination path and filename of your executable.
8. Apply these changes and close the properties page.
9. Select Build from the Build menu


HOW TO RUN THE SAMPLE
=====================

You may run the sample as an application by typing the following from the
sample directory:

Jview JT3Rec.class

or

JT3Rec.exe

The sample is also an applet and may be executed by viewing JT3Rec.htm in
Microsoft Internet Explorer.


USER'S GUIDE
============

In order to receive incoming calls click the Listen button.  To stop listening for
calls, click the Stop button.

When a call arrives the status box will prompt you to click Answer 
Clicking Answer will attempt to connect you to the caller.
