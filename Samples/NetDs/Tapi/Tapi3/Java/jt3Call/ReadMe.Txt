SUMMARY
=======

The JT3Call sample application/applet demonstrates the use of the Telephony API
3.0 to make outgoing calls.

Depending on installed hardware, the applet will allow you to communicate with
others over an IP network connection using streaming audio and video.  One-to-one
connections are supported, but you may also connect to network conferences in
which you can communicate with multiple parties simultaneously.


BEFORE YOU COMPILE/RUN THE SAMPLE
=================================

Before you can compile/run the sample you must perform the following steps:

1. Configure the Telephoney API 3.0
-----------------------------------
TAPI 3.0 is installed by default in Windows NT 5.0.  To ensure that telephoney
support is properly configured on your machine, go to the control panel and
open the "Telephoney" control panel applet.

2.Create the classes.zip file
==============================
Goto the %windir%\system32 directory and run clspack.exe as
clspack -auto
This should generate the classes.zip file in the %windir%\java\classes directory

If you must upgrade to a newer version of the VM, install the version that
comes with the SDK for Java 2.01 (http://www.microsoft.com/java) since you will
need the SDK for the following step.

3. Generate Java/COM Integration Classes for TAPI 3.0
-----------------------------------------------------
To generate these classes you will need to have the SDK for Java 2.0 (or later) 
installed.  Once you have installed the SDK, copy CreateComClassesForTapi3.bat 
to the \bin directory under the main SDK install directory (C:\SDK-Java.201 by default) 
and run it.

WARNING! You must use Jvc version 1.02.3920 or greater to compile files
	 generated by JActiveX.

This will generate the .class files needed to access TAPI 3.0 from Java in the
C:\Winnt\java\trustlib\tapi3 directory.

For more information on how to generate Java/COM
integration classes refer to the SDK for Java 2.01 or later documentation.

4. INSTALL THE ILS SERVER:
=========================
You need to have an ILS server on your network for this sample to run. 
ILS services can be installed from 
Control Panel--> Add/remove programs---->Add/Remove Windows Components-> networking services
----> Details--->SiteServer ILS services

HOW TO COMPILE THE SAMPLE
=========================

Once the above steps are complete you can compile JT3Call by executing the
makeall.bat file.

or you can compile using VJ


1. Install VJ++
2. Create a new Windows Application project
	
	Note:  Select Yes to enable language extensions.
3. Remove the default form1.java file
4. Add following files from the <Platform SDK Dir>\samples\netds\tapi\tapi3\java\jt3call, where
<Platform SDK Dir> is the directory where you installed the Platform SDK.
	appctrls.java
	dialoglayout.java
	jt3call.java

	A. Right-click the default project
	B. Select Add then Add Class
	C. Change to existing tab
	D. Browse to file location above
	E. Add all of the files above
5. Right-click on the default project and select project properties
6. On the Classpath tab add the following new path:
	%windir%\java\classes

	Note: Replace %windir% with the correct windows path.
7. On the Output Format tab, make sure Packaging type is set to Windows EXE.  Note the value of 
the File name field.  This is the destination path and filename of your executable.
8. Apply these changes and close the properties page.
9. Select Build from the Build menu



HOW TO RUN THE SAMPLE
=====================

You may run the sample as an application by typing the following from the
sample directory:

Jview JT3Call.class

or

JT3Call.exe

The sample is also an applet and may be executed by viewing JT3Call.htm in
Microsoft Internet Explorer.


USER'S GUIDE
============

The first thing to note is the "Source Address" combo-box.  It displays
addresses for different service providers installed on your machine.  If a
connect operation does not work, it could be that you are trying to connect
using the wrong source address (e.g., you must use a conferencing source
address to join conferences).

The "Destination Address" text field is where you enter the address you wish
to connect to.  This can be an IP address, a machine name, etc. depending on
the type of connection you are trying to establish. Please change the list
box specifying the address type of the destination call this list box
is labelled as "Address Type"

The "Static Terminals" listbox shows the available static terminals.

Just below the static terminals listbox is the "Number of Video Wnds" text
field.  Here, you enter the number of incoming video streams you want to
see.  Video windows are dynamic terminals.

By the way, terminals are end-points for connections.  There are two types
of them: static and dynamic.  Static terminals are usually tied to hardware
(e.g., speakers or microphones) and have a specific count.  Examples of
dynamic terminals are video windows and files.

To Select audio/video terminals highlight the terminals you would like to 
use so that they would be selected on the call.
