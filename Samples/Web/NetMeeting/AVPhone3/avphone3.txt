OVERVIEW OF THE AVPHONE SAMPLE
==============================

AVPHONE is a Windows sample that demonstrates how to use the
Microsoft NetMeeting Audio & Video API.


BUILDING THE AVPHONE SAMPLE
===========================

Building the sample application requires VC++ Version 6.0 or later.

To build the sample from Visual C++, open the project makefile
(avphone.dsw) as a Microsoft VC++ project, and build as usual.  The 
NetMeeting SDK directories must be added to your VC++ environment.

If your DOS environment is correctly configured, you can build the sample
from the command line by typing "nmake avphone.mak".  The DOS path, include and lib
environment variables must point to the VC installation and the 
NetMeeting SDK directories.


Known Issues: This sample is best viewd on 1024X768 pixels setting. Painting problems are seen sometimes
	      Right after the launch, work around is to minimize and maximize avphone3's window
	      so that UI is reapinted.
