The files contained in the install directory at(\Samples\Internet\delivery\channel)
can be used to subscribe to a sample channel. To make the channel work properly
these files must be placed on an HTTP server, and the path names in the
color.cdf and scrnsave.htm files must reflect their actual URL. To
subscribe to the channel, either double-click the color.cdf file or
right-click the color.cdf file and select "subscribe" on the context
menu. The "subscribe" option will only appear if the local machine has
Internet Explorer 4.0 installed.

The small *.gif files (red, green, and blue) are displayed in the
Channels Explorer bar to represent various channel items. The
Homepage.htm file is the top-level page assigned to the sample color
channel. The browser displays this page whenever the channel is
launched. Page1.htm, Page2.htm, and Page3.htm are displayed in the
browser whenever the corresponding red, green, or blue page is clicked
in the Channels Explorer bar. The Logo_big.gif file is displayed in the
Browser Channels Explorer bar and the Logo_med.gif file is displayed in
the desktop Channel Bar (if the "View as Web page" option is enabled).
Color.cdf is the Channel Definition Format file that defines the sample
color channel.
