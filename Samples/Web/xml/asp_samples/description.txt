Description:
The MSXML component has been designed to also work on the server. The following are some 
simple examples that demonstrate this.

Ping
This demo round-trips an XML document using the XMLHTTP component to post it to 
an ASP script on the server.  The ASP loads the document, and simply writes it back to the client.

Save
This demo posts an XML document to the server and saves it as a file on the server.  You 
can then navigate to the saved file directly.

Shared
This demo posts an XML document to the server and saves it in shared Application state so 
that multiple clients can read and write the document simultaneously without going into 
the file system on the server.

Simple
This demo uses an ASP file to transform XML into HTML on the server, and the HTML returned to 
the browser. This method of displaying XML can be extremely useful to those wanting to deliver 
data encoded in XML to downlevel clients.

Compatibility/Platform Compatibility:
To view these demos, all you need is a browser that supports HTML.  To run the ASP page you need
to have the Internet Explorer 5 MSXML.DLL installed on your server.
