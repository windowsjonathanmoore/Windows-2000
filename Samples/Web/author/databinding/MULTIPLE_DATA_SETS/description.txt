Description:
This web application uses a custom Data Source Object (DSO) authored in Visual Basic to process
user-entered data and display that data using data binding.  The data binding feature highlighted
by this demo is the use of Multiple Data Sets from a single DSO.  From a single OBJECT tag
within the XML page a number of different data sets can be spawned and used to bind data to
HTML.

To run the demo, enter in the loan amount, interest rate, and duration of the loan.  Then
press the "Calculate" button.

More Details:
Using the Multiple Data Sets feature requires a DSO that allows for multiple data sets.
