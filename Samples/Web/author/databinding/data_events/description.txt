Description:
This demo simulates a home shopping scenario with multiple users changing data.  The point of 
this demo is to illustrate the new data events and the new properties on the event object that
have been added for Internet Explorer 5.

The new events are onrowsdelete, onrowsinserted, and oncellchange.  The new properties on the
event object are boundElements, recordset, dataFld, and bookmarks.

Platform Compatibility:
You must be running Internet Explorer 5 or greater to view this demo.

Usage:
These events and properties now provide the web application builder more direct control over
the run-time behavior of the web page.
