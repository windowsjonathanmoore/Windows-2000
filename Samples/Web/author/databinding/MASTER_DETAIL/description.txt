Description:
This demo illustrates the master/detail feature available with Internet Explorer 5.  This
feature allows you to do current record binding on a hierarchical recordset. In this particular case,
the new C++ XMLDSO is being used as the Data Source Object. 

To view the details of each student's performance, click on the "Details" button or on the name itself.
The current record now becomes that of the chosen student and the information contained within that "student" 
element is displayed in the table to the right.

This is also a good example of using ADO methods and properties to process XML data.

Compatibility/Platform Compatibility:
You must be running Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 or greater to view this demo.
