RDS Conflicting Records Demo:

Files:

Description:
Within this demo, the Remote Data Service (RDS) is used to access and download data from an Access table.
This data is then bound to HTML elements on the client.  From the client, the user can alter the 
data and send an update to the server.

Because multiple clients may be accessing the same data, the RDS must be able to manage conflicting
updates (for example, if one user tries to update data that has just been updated by another).  These
conflicts are resolved and the client is notified of the records on which the conflicts occurred.

Through the ADO api, these records can now be retrieved and the user made aware of their 
failed update.

More Details:
Because of server considerations, this demo cannot be run on this site and is available for download 
only.  Remember, you must also register the Access table as a DSN on the server where it resides.

Compatibility/Platform Compatibility:
You must be running Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 or greater to show this demo.  You must
also have access to a server that supports Active Server Pages.
