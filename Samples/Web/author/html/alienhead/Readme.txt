USAGE
======
Public methods and properties are declared within the scriptlet, and 
are manipulated from the container. 

This sample can be run from Internet Explorer 4 or greater.


DETAILS
========
1.  CSS 2-D Positioning 
       - All of the images on the page are arranged in 2-D space.
2.  Event bubbling 
       - The code that allows elements to be positioned is only 15 
         lines long. Each individual graphic does not require separate 
         event handlers. The events are captured at the document level.
