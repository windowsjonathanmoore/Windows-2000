<h2><a name="_web_server_creator"></a>Web Server Creator</h2>
<p>
Server creation, deletion, stopping, starting, configuring: these are all tasks that can keep you very busy, especially if you are an administrator of a large Internet or intranet Web site. This sample tool demonstrates how it is possible, even easy, for you to automate a large number of those tasks. </p>
<p>
This script provides a simple interface through which you can create a new Web server. There are several steps required to accomplish this, starting with invoking <b>GetObject</b> on the IIS://LocalHost/W3SVC node. The <b>IIsWebService</b> object's ADSI method <b>Create</b> is used to create a new <b>IIsWebServer</b> object. The server object is then configured, and the new information written back to the metabase with the <b>SetInfo</b> method.</p>
<p>
At this point in the script, the server is only half-way to becoming a full-fledged Web site. It now has a node in the metabase, but it is not running, nor does it have a root directory in which to store anything. To finish creating the web site, the tool creates an instance of the <b>IIsWebVirtualDir</b> ADSI object, then configures that object to be the new root directory for the new server. <b>SetInfo</b> is once again called to save the information to the metabase, and finally, if all has gone well up to this point, the server object's <b>Start</b> method is invoked. </p>
<p>
Note that almost every major statement group has its own set of error-code checking. This is important when creating any tool in general, but especially tools that use the IIS metabase. </p>
