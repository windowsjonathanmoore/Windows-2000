This directory contains the classes that comprise the Java ASP Component 
Framework. To use, do the following:


1) Compile the framework using the latest Java SDK tools. If you're working 
   in VJ++, you'll need to install the new compiler from the Java SDK. This 
   means copying jvc.exe, jps.dll, and msjvc.dll from the JavaSDK installation 
   into your DevStudio\SharedIDE\bin directory. Also, Make sure you set the 
   destination for the project (Project/settings/Output Directory) to the 
   %windir%\java\trustlib directory.

   Alternatively, you can use the pre-built .class files provided in this 
   directory. To do so, copy *.class to the %windir%\java\trustlib\aspcomp
   directory.

2) Try the samples in the ..\Samples directory. Check out the readme.txt file
   there.
