The \Mssdk\Samples directory contains Platform SDK samples.
These samples demonstrate the use of interfaces and APIs for
Win32 and BackOffice.  The samples run on Windows NT and Windows 95.
Some of the samples use interfaces or APIs that are only available
in beta operating system releases.  Refer to the readme.txt in the 
root of the Platform SDK CD for more information about how to 
build an application using beta interfaces.

The build environment (headers, libraries, and minimum build
tools) for the Platform SDK must be installed in order to build
any of the samples in the \Mssdk\Samples directory. The build
environment can be installed from the readme.htm or by running 
setup.exe on the root of the Platform SDK compact disc. The most 
recent version of the build environment is also available at
http://msdn.microsoft.com/developer/sdk/.

Some components may also require you to install runtimes, depending
on the platform on which you are trying to run the sample.
Redistributables are available in the \Mssdk\Redist subdirectory
on the Platform SDK compact disc.

Documentation for the components listed above can be installed
from the Platform SDK compact disc, or can be viewed online at
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/. This is a free service;
registration is necessary.

Read the release notes in readme.htm and readme.txt in the root of 
the Platform SDK compact disc or visist the MSDN web site for more 
information about the Platform SDK at http://msdn.microsoft.com/developer/sdk/.
