1. What CollMembers Does & How

    This DHTML example will let you connect to an arbitrary instance of the SMS Provider
     and view the members of the SMS default Collections.

    This DHTML page is split up into 2 virtual pages.
     The first page is referred to as the Connection Page.  
      - This page consists of the contents of the Logon div.
     The second page is referred to as the Collection Page.  
      - This page consists of the contents of the ListHeader AND CollMembers div's.

    DHTML lets you hide or display sections of the page dynamically in one browser session without
    making trips back to the server like with Active Server Pages.
