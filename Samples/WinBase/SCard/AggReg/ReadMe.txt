This example shows how a smart card vendor supplying their end users with an
SCSP can use COM aggrigation techniques to build off of the Smart Card Base
Components supplied by Microsoft.

How to compile
==============

1) Make sure all smart card hardware and software components have been setup
   correctly per %MSSDK%\Samples\Winbase\SCard\ReadMe.txt.
2) From the aggreg\test directory, run "NMAKE" to make aggtest.exe.

See %MSSDK%\ReadMe.txt for more information.
