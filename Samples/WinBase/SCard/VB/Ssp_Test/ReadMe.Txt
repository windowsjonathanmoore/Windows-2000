SSP_TEST illustrates how to use the Smart Card SDK low-level SSP COM interfaces
to perform basic smart card functions.  The project expects a data file to be
available on the card (ID: 3F05) of type transparent EF and at least 120 bytes.

Files included in this sample
=============================

1) ReadMe.txt   - This file
2) scardvb.frm  - Main program
3) scardvb.vbp  - Visual Basic Project file

- Detach

How to compile
==============

The following steps must be successfully completed in sequence:

    1) Open the .vbp project
    2) From the Project/References menu, reference the scardssp.tlb type
       library.
    3) Build the project
    4) Save the project

If compile/run of project complains about the following:

    Line 64: Property TextRTF in Test_Step had an invalid value
    Line 77: Property TextRTF in Test_Output had an invalid value
    Line 64: Property TextRTF in Test_Step had an invalid value
    Line 77: Property TextRTF in Test_Output had an invalid value

Save the .frm file and the project and close Visual Basic. Then
re-start Visual Basic and re-open the project.
