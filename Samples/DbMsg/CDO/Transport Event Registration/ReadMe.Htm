</font></b></p>

<p><font face="arial, verdana">The CDO Transport Event Registration Tool is a
sample application that helps you manage your CDO-based SMTP/NNTP event
registrations.&nbsp; The sample demonstrates how to write code that uses SEO
(Server Extensions Objects COM Library) to register your event sinks.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="arial, verdana">CDO (Microsoft Collaboration Data Objects) is a
COM object library for MIME messaging.&nbsp; Using CDO, you can write event
sinks for SMTP and NNTP events.&nbsp; The CDO documentation details how this is
done.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="arial, verdana">The scripts smtpreg.vbs and nntpreg.vbs are
included in the support\scripts directory.&nbsp; These scripts give you the
ability to register for events using a command-line interface.&nbsp; This sample
application puts a GUI on that registration process.</font></p>
<p><font face="arial, verdana">You must have both the SMTP and NNTP services
installed in order to run this tool.</font></p>
<p><font face="arial, verdana">This sample application was written using
Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0, which is required in order to run it.&nbsp; </font></p>
